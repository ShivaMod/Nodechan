		<h1>Welcome to Vectorchan</h1>
		
		<p>Click one of board titles above, such as 'boatdev' or 'music', to visit a board.</p>

		<p>This front page is still under construction, as is most of the site.</p>

		<p>The developer (xenmen) is currently in training for a trade, so no time has been put into development since approximately November 2014. However, I (xenmen) have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xenmen?ty=h">patreon</a> page where you can pledge money for the first proper release of this software. The site as you see it was strictly constructed as a proof-of-concept of how an imageboard built on AngularJS and NodeJS would function.</p>

		<p>If twenty people make a pledge ($1 is fine, I'm just going by number of participants), I'll drop my other non-work activities and get the first release rolled out properly, and get a dedicated server for Vectorchan.</p>

		<p>Note: This website is called Vectorchan, and the repo on github is called 'Nodechan'. For the next version of the software, the github repo will be changed to 'Angchan', to emphasize the importance of AngularJS as the interface, versus the legacy system used by all other imageboards.</p>
